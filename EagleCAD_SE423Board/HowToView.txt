If you would like to just view the Schematic of this board you can go to
https://www.altium.com/viewer/   and upload both the .sch and .brd file.  

If you would like to edit these board files you can install eagleCAD 7.7, (ask Dan for install files)
Or you should be able to import to KiCAD, I have not tried this yet.
You can also import to Autodesk 3DFusion, I have tried this and works pretty well.
